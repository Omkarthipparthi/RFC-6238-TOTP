# RFC-6238-TOTP
Visit this site for the original code https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238
This is the modified version of RFC 6238 TOTP set to 10 Digit instead of 8 digit in the original code.
The original code gives errors for above 8 digit TOTPs, 
this version takes care of that error and provides upto 10 digit TOTPs.
